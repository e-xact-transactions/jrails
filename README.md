jRails
======

jRails is a drop-in jQuery replacement for the prototope-rails gem, so that you can still use RJS and Jquery/JqueryUi helpers with the same API as Prototype/Scryptaculous helpers.

Based on prototype-rails gem.

Support Rails 4+.

I've removed the tasks which added the jQuery and jQueryUI JS files as they were done manually and in asset pipeline it's handled automatically by the jquery-rails and jquery-ui-rails gems.
